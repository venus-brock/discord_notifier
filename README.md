This is a python script that I use to notify me of Discord announcements that I
consider important now that I am no longer actively using Discord. This requires
some annoying setup which I won't go into detail on here, but if you're familiar
with running Discord bots it should be pretty simple. The alert sound effect
(which you can easily replace with your own if you wish) was created using
Rubidium and was intended to loosely mimic certain Windows 9X sound effects.
