This is a python script that I use to notify me of Discord announcements that I
consider important now that I am no longer actively using Discord. This requires
some annoying setup which I won't go into detail on here, but if you're familiar
with running Discord bots it should be pretty simple. The alert sound effect
(which you can easily replace with your own if you wish) was created using
Rubidium and was intended to loosely mimic certain Windows 9X sound effects.

I've only been able to get this shit working with python 3.10, even though
pycord supposedly supports python 3.10 through 3.13. I have no idea why this may
be the case, as I do not follow the development of python nor do I intend to
start.
